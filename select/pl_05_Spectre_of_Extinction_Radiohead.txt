Our will, impersonal, blind
A gulf at the heart of the world
Dark as the absence of light
Death as the absence of all life
To touch the deepest depths
Through the denial of the will
The spectre of extinction
Eternal in its rage
The reverence and the fall
The purity of our cage
The black depths of
the cosmos itself
An impersonal nothing
Demonic contagion
Indifferent and immaterial
To touch the deepest depths
Through the denial of the will
The spectre of extinction
Eternal in its rage
The reverence and the fall
The purity of our cage
The purity of our cage
Contagious, in life, in death
With cataclysmic force
The abstract is now weaponized
Into parasitic forms
Amorphous and surreal
As phantoms
without face or shape
The spectre of extinction
Eternal in its rage
The reverence and the fall
The purity of our cage
The purity of our cage
